# buildmanagement
This exercise is part of the course "Open Source Software Engineering" at Furtwangen University.
It consists of multiple parts, as the original project from exercise 5 is then enhanced to include multiple other exercises.

As a part of exercise 6, we were meant to install and run the Eclipse plugin "Infinitest". The plugin installation failed on all attempts.
