# buildmanagement
This exercise is part of the course "Open Source Software Engineering" at Furtwangen University.
It consists of multiple parts, as the original project from exercise 5 is then enhanced to include multiple other exercises.

As a part of exercise 6, we were meant to install and run the Eclipse plugin "Infinitest". The plugin installation failed on all attempts.

In exercise 7, Date is used despite all human-readable formats being deprecated. This is to avoid having to change the original code provided.
